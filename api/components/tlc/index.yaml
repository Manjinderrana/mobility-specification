  - Term: Settlement Window
    Api: search/on_search/init/on_init
    Attribute: SETTLEMENT_WINDOW
    Owner: Collector (Either BAP or BPP)
    Value: |-
      Time period
      (ISO8601 format)
    Description: >-
      The time period from completion of the Settlement Basis within which the
      Payment Collector will settle with counterparty Network Participant(s). As
      an example, if the Settlement Basis is set as “delivery” and the
      Settlement Window is set to 7 days, and the Seller App collects the

      before the completion of the 7th day after delivery,

      ISO8601 duration notation is used to specify the value of the parameter.
      As an illustration, a Settlement Window of 5 days after delivery can be
      specified as “P5D” (i.e. period 5 days) or “PT120H” (i.e. period 120

      Network Participant for the instant transaction.

      For clarity, if the Buyer App is the Payment Collector, the Buyer App will

      App is the Payment Collector, they will remit the Buyer App’s fees, deduct

      share of the Buyer Price to the Seller App’s account via RTGS.

      This is the annual rate of interest that the Payment Collector will be
      charged if they delay a payment to the counterparty Network Participant,
      calculated pro rata for each calendar day of delay. As an example, if the
      value is set as “7.3”, and the amount of payment due is INR 1000, that
      will mean the Payment Collector will pay the counterparty Network
      Participant an interest of 7.3% per annum (i.e. INR 100), calculated pro
      rata for each day of delay. So if the Payment Collector delay was 50 days,
      the total interest payable would be INR 10 [calculated as
      1000x(7.3/100)x(50/365)]

      Protocol. If there is a conflict between the terms decided through the
      Protocol, and the Static Terms, the terms decided through the ONDC
      Protocol will prevail. Also, if there is a conflict between the Static
      Terms and the ONDC Network Policy or the Static Terms and the Network
      Participant Agreement, the terms of the ONDC Network Policy or the Network
      Participant Agreement (as the case may be) will prevail.
